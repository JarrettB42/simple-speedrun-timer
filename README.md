# simple-speedrun-timer
A lua script for OBS that provides a hotkey controlled text timer for timed content (marathons, speedruns, etc.).

# notes

You can unpause the timer. This will cause it to snap forward, as if it were never paused. This is to account for accidental pauses in a marathon.

Also, you can only reset the timer while it is paused. This is to help prevent accidental resets in a marathon.
